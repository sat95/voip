#Experiences
- At the begining it felt bit difficult but after reading the Pulseaudio online documentation and Sockets man pages it became much more simple.
- Using of error checking in the code helped me a lot in the debugging.
- I learned using of high level APIs to communicate with hardware and when something goes wrong where to look for it.
- I struggled during the instllation and compiling of libpulse libraries as i didnt look into the ppt but later somehow figured out by myself the 
problems with linking and compilation.
- A significant delay of 1-2 seconds still exists for which i havent found any solution yet.
